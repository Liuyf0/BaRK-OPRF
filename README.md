LPP-BPSI

### Required libraries

 C++ compiler with C++11 support. There are several library dependencies including [`Boost`](https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/), [`Crypto++`](http://www.cryptopp.com/), [`Miracl`](https://github.com/miracl/MIRACL), and [`Mpir`](http://mpir.org/). Our code has been tested on both Windows (Microsoft Visual Studio) and Linux. To install the required libraries: 
  * windows: open PowerShell,  `cd ./thirdparty`, and `.\all_win.ps1` 
  * linux: `cd ./thirdparty`, and `bash .\all_linux.get`.
